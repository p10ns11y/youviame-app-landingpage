          <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Overview.<br></span><span class="c1">Arbitration is an alternative to litigation where a neutral person (the arbitrator) hears and decides the parties&rsquo; dispute. Arbitration proceedings are designed to provide parties with a fair hearing in a manner that is faster and less formal than court proceedings. The following procedures (the &ldquo;Arbitration Procedures&rdquo;) are applicable to all arbitration proceedings involving you and Youviame.</span>

          <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Administrator.<br></span><span class="c7">The administrator for the arbitration is the Swedish Arbitration Association (&ldquo;SAA&rdquo;), a non-profit organization that is not affiliated with Youviame. &nbsp;The SAA facilitates, but does not itself conduct, the arbitration. The arbitrator who will hear and decide your dispute will be chosen from the SAA&rsquo;s roster of neutral arbitrators. For information on the SAA, please visit its website, http://swedisharbitration.se/. <br>Information about the SAA&rsquo;s rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the SAA&rsquo;s consumer arbitration page, </span><span class="c4"><a class="c6" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://swedisharbitration.se/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1486141819736000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG2P1gTQf-Q-NYoAPRA2nwxBsyCIw">http://swedisharbitration.se/</a></span>

          <p class="c0"><span class="c2">Applicable Rules.<br></span><span class="c1">The arbitration will be governed by the SAA&rsquo;s Consumer Arbitration Rules (the &ldquo;SAA Rules&rdquo;), as modified by these Arbitration Procedures. If there is any inconsistency between the SAA Rules and these Arbitration Procedures, the Arbitration Procedures will control. However, if the arbitrator determines that strict application of the Arbitration Procedures would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration, the arbitrator may make any order necessary to provide a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent with the SAA Rules.</span>

The responding party shall provide the requesting party with all responsive, non-privileged documents, the requested particulars, and/or any objections to the requests within 15 days after receipt of the requests. Any disputes about discovery or requests for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the arbitrator for prompt resolution. In ruling on any discovery dispute or extension request, the arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature, amount, and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort what would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the case schedule, and whether the requested discovery is necessary for the adequate preparation of a claim or defense.<br><br></span>
